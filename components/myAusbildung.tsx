      "Since childhood, I have been drawn to building things and exploring technology, so pursuing a career in tech was a natural choice for me. In 2023, I began my apprenticeship as a Developer at the international repair service, where I gained comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience in development.",

    description:
      "In my first year, I focused on building a solid foundation in software development. I learned to work with the core technologies of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PHP. Getting familiar with professional workflows, version control, and agile teamwork helped me understand how real projects take shape. I gradually moved from small tasks to contributing to meaningful features, gaining confidence in both my skills and collaboration. This year laid the groundwork for my growth and prepared me for more complex challenges.",

    title: "2nd Year",
    description:
      "During my second year, I expanded my skill set into modern front-end development, learning TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind. With these new technologies, I began developing the company’s internal intranet platform—an interactive space for colleagues to share updates and connect. Working on this project helped me apply what I learned in a real-world environment and strengthened my understanding of building dynamic, user-focused applications. It marked the point where I started truly shaping product experiences rather than just contributing to them.",

    title: "3rd Year",
    description:
      "In my third year, I continued developing the intranet and significantly expanded its features and overall quality. I focused on improving responsiveness, UI and UX design, smooth user interactions, animations, and loading performance. Additionally, I built an admin dashboard that allowed administrators to manage the platform directly within the Next.js application. This phase gave me the opportunity to refine both technical and design skills, while taking full ownership of a production-level product.",

I’m excited to explore new perspectives, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue developing my craft in the world of software development.",
